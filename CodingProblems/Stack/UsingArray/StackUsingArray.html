<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>Implement a stack using an array (fixed size).</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>If a variable sized data structure is used then the problem is trivial,
just add &amp; take from the data structure as needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The following operations should be defined:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Construction - Construct the object containing the stacks.<br />
Push - Add an item to one of the stacks.<br />
Pop - Pop an item from one of the stacks.<br />
Peek - Peek at the top item in one of the stacks.<br />
Count - Get the count of one of the stacks.</p>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>No need to clear (zero) popped elements in the array itself. These elements will
automatically be overridden with new elements when the array slot is next
used.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Fixed size stack - A stack is implemented that has a maximum size set during construction.</li>
<li>Variable size stack - A stack is implemented that can grow as needed.</li>
</ol>
