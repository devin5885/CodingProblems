# Binary Tree Is Full

## Problem
Write a method to check whether a binary tree is full. A tree is full if
there are no nodes that have a single child node (i.e.) all nodes have
zero or two children.

## Requirements
- A null tree should return true.

- Method to implement:

| Name       | IsFull                                                        |
| Parameters | The binary tree to check                                      |
| Returns    | True if the tree is full, false otherwise.                    |

## Solutions
1. Standard - Simple iterative solution using DFS like algorithm.
