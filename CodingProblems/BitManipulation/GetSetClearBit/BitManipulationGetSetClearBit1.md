# Solution 1 - Standard

## Requirements

## Implementation

### GetBit

Steps:
1. Build a mask with 1 in the specified index position & 0's in all others.
2. And with the number return true if the result is not zero and false otherwise.

Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)

### SetClearBit

Steps:
1. Build a mask with 1 in the specified index position & 0's in all others.
2. For set or the mask with the number & return the result.
3. For clear and the ~ of the mask with the number & return the result.

Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)

## Notes
1. Standard - Simple solution.
