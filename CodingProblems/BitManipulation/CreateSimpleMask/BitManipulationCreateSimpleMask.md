# Create Simple Mask

## Problem
Implement a method to create a simple mask. A simple mask is defined a mask
 that has a specific number of contiguous bits set, with all other bits
being cleared (i.e.) 0..1..1..0. Note also that the opposite simple mask
(i.e.) a mask with 1..0..0..1 can be generated by first generating the
non-opposite mask & using the binary not ~ operator.

## Requirements

- Method to implement:  

Name: CreateSimpleMask
Parameters: The most and least significant bit indexes to set.
Returns: The resulting mask (as a signed integer).

## Solutions
1. Standard - Create the mask using bit shifting. (Very efficient)
