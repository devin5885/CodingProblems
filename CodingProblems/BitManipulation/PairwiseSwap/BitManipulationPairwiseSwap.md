# Pairwise Swap
- From Cracking the Coding Interview, Interview Questions 5.7

## Problem
- Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions
as possible. (e.g.) bit 0 and 1 are swapped, bit 2 and 3 are swapped etc.

## Requirements
- The values are signed.
- For now we will assume 32-bit values, this could be changed in the future.

- Method to implement:  
Name: SwapOddEvenBits  
Parameters: The signed integer to swap the bits.  
Returns: The updated value.

## Solutions
1. Brute Force
2. Clear and Shift
