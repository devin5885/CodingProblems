 that has a repeating pattern of bits set & cleared.

## Requirements

- Method to implement:  

Name: CreatePatternMask
Parameters: The pattern to set specified as a signed integer and the bit count
 of the mask (which may include proceeding zero bits) to consider.
Returns: The resulting mask (as a signed integer).

## Solutions
