# Route Between Nodes
- From Cracking the Coding Interview, Interview Questions 4.1

## Problem
Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route
between two nodes.

## Requirements
- If either node is null, an exception should be thrown.

- Nodes are not mutable.

- We can use additional data structures.

- Method to implement:  
Name: RouteBetweenNodes  
Parameters: The start node & end node.  
Returns: True if there is a path between nodes, false otherwise.  
 
## Solutions
1. Simple Iterative BFS
2. Simple Recursive DFS (TODO)
