# Triple Step  

(From Cracking the Coding Interview, Interview Questions 8.1)

---

## Problem
A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step, 2
 steps, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many ways the
child can run up the stairs.

---

## Requirements
- It will be assumed that the # of steps is a positive integer greater than 0.
The method should throw an exception if this is not the case.

- Method to implement:  

|            |                             |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| Name       | CountWays                   |
| Parameters | The number of steps         |
| Returns    | The number of combinations  |

## Solutions
1. Compute and Count Recursive - Solve the problem by computing all combinations and counting them. (Recursively)
2. Compute and Count Iterative - Solve the problem by computing all combinations and counting them. (Iteratively)
3. Count Recursion - Solve the problem similarly to the Fibonacci problem (CrCI Solution)
4. Count Recursion with Memoization - Solve the problem similarly to the Fibonacci problem (CrCI Solution)
