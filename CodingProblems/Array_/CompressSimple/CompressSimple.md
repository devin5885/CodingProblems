# Compress Simple

---

## Problem
Perform simple compression on a list by parsing the list and converting it to
a list of each element and the count of consecutive matching elements
followed by the element itself.

(e.g.) a list of 10, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20, 30, 15, 15, 15
would return 4, 10, 2, 20, 1, 30, 3, 15.

## Requirements
- The method should throw an exception if the list is null.

- Method to implement:  

|            |                                                               |
