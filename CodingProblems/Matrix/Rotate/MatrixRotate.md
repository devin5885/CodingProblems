# MatrixRotate
- From Cracking the Coding Interview, Interview Questions 1.7

## Problem
Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the
 image is 4 bytes (an int), write a method to rotate the image by
 90 degrees.

## Requirements
- Null matrix should throw an exception.
- The matrix should be rotated in place (i.e.) No additional data structures should be needed.

- Method to implement:  
Name: Rotate
Parameters: The matrix (2x2 array) to rotate.   
Returns: None

## Solutions
1. Standard
