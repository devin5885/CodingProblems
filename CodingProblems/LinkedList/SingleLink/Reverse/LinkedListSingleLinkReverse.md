# Reverse

## Problem
Reverse some or all elements of a singly linked list.

## Requirements
- The method should have defaults such that if additional parameters are
not specified the entire list is reversed.

- If the starting node or ending node is specified and is not in the list 
the method should throw an exception. (This includes the case in which
the end node is before the start node in the list).

- Method to implement:  

|            |                                                               |

| Parameters | The list to reverse                                           |
|            | The starting node (default to first node in the list)         |
