# (Linked List Single) Find Intersection
- From Cracking the Coding Interview, Interview Questions 2.7

## Problem
Given two singly linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return the
 intersecting node. Bite that the intersection is based on reference not value.
 That is, if a node of the first linked list is the exact same node 
(by reference) as a node of the second linked list then they are intersecting.

## Requirements
- If either list is a null ref then null should be returned.

- Method to implement:  
Name: FindIntersection
Parameters: Two list references.
Returns: The intersection node or null if no intersection.
