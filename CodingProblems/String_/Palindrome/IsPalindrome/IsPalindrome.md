# Is Palidrome

---

## Problem
Write a method to check whether a string is a palindrome.

---

## Requirements
- The method should throw an exception if the string is null.

- Method to implement:  

|            |                                                               |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name       | IsPalidrome                                                   |
| Parameters | The input string.                                             |
| Returns    | True if the input string is a palindrome, false otherwise.    |

## Solutions
1. Standard - Simple solution.

## Notes
- There is also a solution that uses stacks, since this implementation does not
have any advantages over the standard implementation, it is under 'Stacks'.
