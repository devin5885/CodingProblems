# Get Permutations

---

## Problem
Write a method to compute all permutations of a string.

---

## Requirements
- For the null string an empty set of permutations should be returned.

- Method to implement:  

|            |                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Name       | GetPermutations                                 |
| Parameters | The string                                      |
| Returns    | A list of string permutations                   |

## Solutions
1. No Duplicates By Char Iterative - Generate permutations by processing the
array character by character and building & storing the resulting permutations.
